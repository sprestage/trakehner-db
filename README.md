The Unofficial Trakehner Database
=======

I found researching the bloodlines, inspection scores, performance records, and progeny of a Trakehner horse to 
be frustratingly difficult in that it was slow, not every horse in the pegigree had a link, and most did not
have the scores or comments from their inspection.  

This site is my solution to those problems.
